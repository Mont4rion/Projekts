# My First Steps in Programming

Welcome to my repository for beginner-level programming projects! These projects represent my initial ventures into coding and serve as a record of my learning journey.

**Important Note for Non-German Speakers:**

You'll notice that many of the variable names, comments, and internal documentation are in **German**. This is because I primarily learned and developed these projects in a German-speaking environment. While the core logic should be universally understandable, some elements might require a quick translation if you're not familiar with German.

I hope you find these projects interesting, despite the language barrier in the comments!
